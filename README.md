## 🏗️ Kagaya

**Kagaya** is a modern feature flag and experimentation platform built to enable safe, controlled, and data-driven feature releases.

It combines a flexible **GraphQL control plane** for managing flags and experiments with a **low-latency evaluation engine** designed for real-time decision making. Kagaya also includes an **event-driven analytics pipeline** that captures evaluation metrics and provides insights into feature performance.

The system is designed using a modular monolith architecture with strong domain boundaries, making it easy to scale horizontally and evolve into microservices over time.

Kagaya demonstrates real-world backend engineering patterns such as CQRS, event-driven processing, caching strategies, and high-throughput ingestion — making it both a practical platform and a system design showcase.
